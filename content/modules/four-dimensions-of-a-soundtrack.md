# Sound for Moving Pictures: The Four Sound Areas


An interview with Neil Hillman [# [Sound for Moving Pictures: the Four Sound Areas | an Interview with Neil Hillman](https://soundand.design/sound-for-moving-pictures-the-four-sound-areas-an-interview-with-neil-hillman-b3e06f59a1a3)]

All moving picture soundtracks (film, TV, etc.) are created from a compound of four distinct sound elements, narrative, abstract, temporal, and spatial. Using these areas, we can create a framework for discussing emotional sound design construction, deconstruction, and communication. 

- Narrative 
	- concerned with a sound that carries direct communication and meaning. Dialogue and commentary are the most important examples of this area, including symbolic and signaling sounds such as ringtones, sirens, and other sounds, as well as music with a clearly defined meaning.
- Abstract Sound
	- concerned with sounds that have a less codified and precise meaning. Examples of these include atmospheres, backgrounds, room tones, sound effects, and music. 
- Temporal sound 
	- concerned with the evolution in time of the sound design. Its characteristics are rhythm, pace, and punctuation. This area can include music, sound effects, and voice. 
- Spatial sound 
	- concerned with the positioning of sounds within a three-dimensional sound field and the space placed around the presented sound.
