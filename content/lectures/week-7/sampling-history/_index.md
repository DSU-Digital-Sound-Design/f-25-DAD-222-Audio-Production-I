The earliest examples of sampling can be traced back to the early 20th century, when jazz musicians began to incorporate snippets of other recordings into their live performances. This practice, known as "borrowing" or "quoting," was seen as a way to pay homage to fellow musicians and to add new and unexpected elements to their own music.

In the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed a new genre of music called musique concrète, which involved manipulating recorded sounds to create new compositions. Schaeffer used a variety of techniques, including sampling, to create his music, and his work is considered to be one of the earliest examples of electronic music.

The first commercial samplers were released in the late 1970s, and they quickly became popular among hip hop artists. DJs began using samplers to create new beats by isolating and looping drum breaks and other instrumental passages from existing recordings. This technique, known as breakbeat sampling, played a vital role in the development of hip hop music.
