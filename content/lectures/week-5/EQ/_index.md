## Equalization uses

1. Adjusting sound tone.
2. Fixing frequency problems.
3. Balancing instruments in a mix.
4. Enhancing clarity and presence.
5. Removing unwanted noise.
6. Creating special effects.

In audio and sound engineering, "EQ" stands for equalization. Equalization is a fundamental tool used to adjust the balance of frequencies in an audio signal. EQ is used for a variety of purposes in audio production, live sound reinforcement, and music mixing. Here are some common uses of EQ in audio:

1. **Tone Shaping**: EQ is often used to shape the tonal characteristics of a sound source. You can boost or cut specific frequency ranges to make an instrument or voice sound warmer, brighter, or more natural.

2. **Fixing Frequency Problems**: Sometimes, audio recordings or live sound environments can have unwanted resonances, hums, or noise in certain frequency ranges. EQ can be used to reduce or eliminate these issues.

3. **Balancing Instruments**: In a mix, different instruments and vocals can clash in terms of frequency content. EQ helps in carving out space for each instrument and making sure they don't step on each other's sonic territory.

4. **Enhancing Clarity**: By boosting the high frequencies (treble) of a signal, you can increase clarity and presence, making it easier for the listener to hear details in the sound.

5. **Removing Unwanted Noise**: EQ can be used to roll off low frequencies that might contain rumble or wind noise. High-pass filters are a common tool for this purpose.

6. **Creating Special Effects**: Extreme EQ settings can be used creatively to achieve special effects like a telephone voice (narrow bandpass), a radio broadcast sound (filtered high frequencies), or a vintage vinyl record effect (boosting certain frequency ranges while cutting others).

7. **Room Correction**: In audio production, it's important to ensure that the playback environment doesn't color the sound. Room correction EQ systems can analyze the room's acoustics and apply EQ to compensate for any uneven frequency response caused by the room itself.

8. **Feedback Control**: In live sound reinforcement, EQ can be used to prevent feedback by notching out frequencies that are prone to feedback in a particular room or setup.

9. **Matched EQ**: You can use EQ to match the tonal characteristics of two different audio sources, like matching the sound of two guitar amplifiers or blending two different microphone recordings of the same instrument.

10. **Mastering**: In the final stages of audio production, mastering engineers use EQ to fine-tune the overall tonal balance of a mix and prepare it for distribution.

11. **Sound Design**: Sound designers for film, video games, and other media use EQ to shape and manipulate audio elements to create specific atmospheres, textures, and moods.

12. **DJ Mixing**: DJs use EQ on their mixers to blend songs smoothly by adjusting the bass, midrange, and treble frequencies of two tracks to match.

13. **Live Performance**: Musicians and bands often use EQ on their instruments and vocal channels to optimize their sound in a live setting, adapting to the acoustics of the venue.

## EQ Project 

Find three loops from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) or Looperman: 

1. full frequency range
2. high mid-range to high-frequency 
3. low-frequency
