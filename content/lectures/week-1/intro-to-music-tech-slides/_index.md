## Quick Activity: Exploring 120 Years of Electronic Music

* Visit [120years.net](https://120years.net/)
* Spend a few minutes browsing the site
* Pick one instrument, invention, or story that stands out to you

{{% note %}}

* Encourage students not to overthink — just choose something surprising, weird, or cool.
  {{% /note %}}

---

## Step 2: Small Group Sharing

* Turn to a partner or small group
* Share what you found:

  * What is it called and when was it made?
  * What stood out to you (design, sound, history)?
  * Can you connect it to anything you already know about music or sound design?

{{% note %}}

* Keep this short — a couple of minutes each.
* Aim for curiosity, not detailed research.
  {{% /note %}}

---

## Step 3: Whole Class Discussion

* Volunteers share highlights
* Guiding questions:

  * Did anyone find an instrument that feels like an ancestor to today’s tech?
  * Did you notice recurring themes in invention or use?
  * Which ones seemed totally bizarre or impractical?

{{% note %}}

* End by tying discoveries back to sound design history and innovation.
