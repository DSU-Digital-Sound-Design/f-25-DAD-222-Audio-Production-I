For this assignment **you will work in a team of three** to add Foley sound effects to a short, silent, digital animation. 

What sound sources do you use? Think about the materials that were used to make the robot. Consider the surface it stands on and the room it is in. Imagine the mechanisms at work within the metal that forms its "skin." Considering these will help you find the proper objects for your Foley design.  

You may organize your work in any way you see fit. I recommend thinking of the character in three parts\: feet & legs, torso & head, arms & fingers. If each group member is responsible for the sounds of the various robot parts, you should be able to cover the entire character sonically. _Animation_ means "bring to life." Reflect on the kinds of sounds that will further convey an impression of "life" and work these into your Foley design. 
 
Project requirements:  
-	The animation is 10 seconds long; all events that make a sound must be represented somehow.  
-	All sound-making objects are fair game for this assignment but **you can not use anything explosive or otherwise dangerous**.  
-	Evaluations will be based on the performance and sound quality of the entire group. Work together, and everyone will benefit!
