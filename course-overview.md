# DAD 222: Audio Production I – Course Overview

Welcome to Audio Production I! This course introduces the fundamentals of audio production, including recording, editing, mixing, and critical listening. Below is a detailed overview of the course structure, key topics, resources, and expectations.

## Course Description
This course is designed for students new to audio production. It covers the basics of sound, signal flow, microphone techniques, digital audio workstations (DAWs), and essential mixing concepts. Through lectures, hands-on labs, and creative projects, students will develop foundational skills for music, podcast, and media production.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Describe the physical properties of sound and basic acoustics
- Operate recording equipment and microphones
- Use a DAW (such as Logic Pro X or Reaper) for editing and mixing
- Apply basic effects and processing (EQ, compression, reverb)
- Plan and execute simple recording sessions
- Critically listen and analyze audio productions

## Major Topics
- **Sound & Hearing:** Physics of sound, waveforms, frequency, amplitude
- **Microphones & Recording:** Types, placement, and signal flow
- **Digital Audio:** Sampling, bit depth, file formats
- **DAWs:** Introduction to Logic Pro X and Reaper
- **Editing & Mixing:** Basic editing, EQ, compression, reverb, and balance
- **Critical Listening:** Ear training and analysis of professional recordings
- **Creative Projects:** Music, podcast, and sound design assignments

## Course Structure
- **Lectures:** Weekly sessions covering theory and demonstrations
